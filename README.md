# Sensor Data Monitoring Project with Arduino Uno

Welcome to our Sensor Data Monitoring Project! This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of Arduino Uno in collecting and processing data from various sensors. By utilizing an Arduino Uno board along with Python scripting, we can effectively monitor vital parameters such as temperature, heart rate, oxygen levels, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings.

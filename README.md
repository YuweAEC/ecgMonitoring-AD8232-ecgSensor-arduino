# Sensor Data Monitoring Project with Arduino Uno

Welcome to our Sensor Data Monitoring Project! This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of Arduino Uno in collecting and processing data from various sensors. By utilizing an Arduino Uno board along with Python scripting, we can effectively monitor vital parameters such as temperature, heart rate, oxygen levels, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings.

## Components Used

### Sensors and Modules:
- **AD8232 ECG Sensor:** Captures electrocardiogram (ECG) data, providing insights into heart activity.
- **LM35 Temperature Sensor:** Offers precise temperature readings in Celsius, ideal for environmental monitoring.
- **DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Probe:** A rugged probe for measuring temperature in aquatic environments and industrial applications.
- **MAX30102 Heart Rate and Pulse Oximeter Sensor Module:** Measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels, crucial for health monitoring.
- **5V Active Buzzer Module:** Provides audible alerts or notifications based on sensor readings.

### Hardware:
- **Arduino Uno:** The central microcontroller board responsible for interfacing with sensors and executing firmware.
- **Breadboard 840 Pin:** Offers a convenient platform for prototyping and connecting electronic components.
- **USB A to Mini B Cable:** Facilitates communication and programming of the Arduino Uno.

### Wiring Accessories:
- **Male-to-Female, Male-to-Male, and Female-to-Female Jumper Wires:** Essential for establishing connections between components on the breadboard.
